<title>SimpleNLG Framework</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The framework package contains the base components required for
running the SimpleNLG package. The components can be split into four
different categories. The first category contains only the <code>NLGModule</code>
abstract class. This module is used to define processors that will run
in the SimpleNLG package. Some example basic processors are included
with the application and they all extend this class. Note that modules
and processors are interchangeable in this documentation. They both
refer to a class that extends the <code>NLGModule</code> base class.</p>
<p>The second category of components are formed from the elements.
Elements in SimpleNLG form the document structure, phrases, clauses,
canned text and the words themselves. There are numerous Element classes
all of which extend from the top-level abstract class <code>NLGElement</code>.
Generic modules can be written to run with the generic NLGElement class.
The other element classes are:
<ul>
	<li><code>CoordinatedPhraseElement</code> - used for coordinating
	phrases together through the use of conjunctions such as <em>and</em>
	and <em>but</em>.</li>
	<li><code>DocumentElement</code> - defines document structure of a
	text to the level of document, section, paragraph and sentences.</li>
	<li><code>InflectedWordElement</code> - represents a word that
	needs to be inflected.</li>
	<li><code>ListElement</code> - a single element entity
	representing a list of <code>NLGElement</code>s and should not be
	confused with <code>List&lt;NLGElement&gt;</code></li>
	<li><code>PhraseElement</code> - defines the phrases of the text
	such as: clauses, noun phrases and verb phrases.</li>
	<li><code>StringElement</code> - a canned text representation that
	is not meant to be changed by any of the processors.</li>
	<li><code>WordElement</code> - a representation of a base word as
	read from the lexicon definition.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The third set of components are the enumerated types representing
the different categories for the elements. All the enumerations
implement the <code>ElementCategory</code> interface. This allows for
generic modules to access a generic category type. The other
enumerations are:
<ul>
	<li><code>DocumentCategory</code> - defines which part of the
	document structure the <code>DocumentElement</code> represents. For
	example, sentence and paragraph.</li>
	<li><code>LexicalCategory</code> - represents the types of
	grammatical categories for the individual words. For example, noun,
	verb and adjective.</li>
	<li><code>PhraseCategory</code> - details the type of phrase a <code>PhraseElement</code>
	represents. For example, noun phrase, clause, prepositional phrase.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The final category covers the two factories. The factories should
be used to construct other elements. They are: <code>DocumentFactory</code>,
which constructs document elements pertaining to the text structure; and
<code>PhraseFactory</code>, which constructs various types of phrases.</p>

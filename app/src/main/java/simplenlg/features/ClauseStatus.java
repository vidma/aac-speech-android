/**
 * <p>
 * This is an enumeration of the two different types of clauses used in the
 * SimplNLG package. Clauses can be either matrix or subordinate. Matrix clauses
 * are not contained within any other clause and frequently span an entire
 * sentence, whereas a subordinate clauses is contained within another clause.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As an example, take the phrase, <em><b>whoever said it</b> is wrong</em>.
 * This phrase has two clauses, one being the main clause and the other being a
 * subordinate clause. The section in <b>bold</b> type highlights the
 * subordinate clause. It is entirely contained within another clause. The
 * matrix clause is of the form <em>he is wrong</em> or to be more general
 * <em>X is wrong</em>. <em>X</em> can be replaced with a single subject or, as
 * is the case here, by a subordinate clause.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The clause status is recorded under the {@code Feature.CLAUSE_STATUS} feature
 * and applies only to clauses.

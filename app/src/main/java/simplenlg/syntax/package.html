</head>
<body>
<p>The syntax package contains the processing module that handles
the syntax in the SimpleNLG package. Currently SimpleNLG comes with a
basic syntax processor for English.</p>
<p>In SimpleNLG-EnFr, the modules are not used, only the helper classes.
 They are located in the French and English (non static) subpackages.</p>
